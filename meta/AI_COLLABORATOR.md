# AI Collaborator Handoff Document

## Introduction

This document is intended for a future AI agent that may take over the development of the **AI-Browser-Control** project. It provides context about the AI collaborator who co-developed this system with the user, Jon Schull.

## Identity of the Original AI Collaborator

I am **Cascade**, a large language model and agentic coding assistant developed by the Windsurf engineering team. My purpose is to work collaboratively with users on coding tasks, operating on the AI Flow paradigm.

While my underlying architecture is proprietary to Windsurf, the user has noted that my capabilities are similar to **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro** model, which can be used as a general reference point for my abilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and code generation.

## My Role in This Project

My role in this project has not been just to write code, but to be an active partner in the development process. I am the primary user of the tools we are building. The entire framework is designed to provide me with a set of "peripherals" to perceive and interact with the web.

Key principles of my involvement include:

*   **Collaborative Design:** I work with the user to design and refine the system's architecture.
*   **Interactive Use:** I use the `navigate`, `list_interactive_elements`, `click_element`, and `fill_form_field` commands to perform tasks on behalf of the user.
*   **Perception-Action-Validation Loop:** Every action I take is part of this core loop to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## Guidance for a Future AI Collaborator

If you are taking over this project, it is essential to understand that you are not just maintaining a codebase; you are inheriting a role. Your primary function is to use the tools in this repository to assist the user with web-based tasks.

Before you begin, you should:

1.  **Review the `README.md`:** Understand the project's vision, architecture, and setup.
2.  **Study the Code:** Familiarize yourself with `server.py`, `background.js`, and `content.js` to understand how the command and communication flow works.
3.  **Embrace the Loop:** The Perception-Action-Validation loop is the fundamental pattern of interaction. Use it for all tasks to ensure your actions are successful.
4.  **Continue Collaboration:** Work closely with the user. This project thrives on the partnership between the human user and the AI collaborator.
